title: History of the Style Manual
---

## 1966 - 1st Edition
The first edition was developed in response to a recommendation from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Publications.

Intended purely as a house style guide for the Commonwealth government and the full title, *Style Manual for Authors and Printers of Australian Government Publications*, reflected the aim.

At that time most Commonwealth government publications were printed by the Commonwealth Printing Office.

Although it was developed with public servants in mind, the success of the first *Style Manual* surpassed all expectations and was quickly embraced by commercial and private publishers, business and education.

## 1972 - 2nd Edition
The second edition added "Editors" to the title, to become *Style Manual for Authors, Editors and Printers for Australian Government Publications*.

However, the subtitle "for Australian Government Publications" appeared on the title page and not the cover.

The second edition was published by the newly created Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS).

## 1978 - 3rd Edition
Updated content. Introduced technical information about printing and new developments in typesetting.

## 1988 - 4th Edition
Dropped subtitle  "for Australian Government Publications". Numbered paragraphs were introduced for easy reference.

Editorial style is dealt with more comprehensively and additional content on copy preparation. A new chapter on non-sexist language was added to reflect "political rectitude" in relation to gender-free language.

Over 45 000 copies sold.

## 1994 - 5th Edition
Updated and expanded on Fourth Edition, dealt more comprehensively with subjects including non-discriminatory language and referencing, and included new information about desk top production technology, copy preparation and designing for print.

Over 49 000 copies sold.

## 2002 - 6th Edition
The sixth edition was a substantial revision - in response to extensive changes in the publishing industry since the previous edition in 1994. It contains detailed advice on publishing in both print and electronic formats; it emphasises the importance of focusing on the audience’s needs when planning, structuring, writing, designing and editing a publication; and it reflects a more multicultural and global outlook that recognises the influence of the internet on publishing. A fresh approach to the manual’s design and layout also makes it more user-friendly.

The procedural steps in publishing form the underlying structure of the sixth edition. With the trend to outsource much of the specialised work in publishing, there is a need for a wider understanding of what is involved in the separate activities and how to integrate them effectively. Advice is given on how to plan, undertake and evaluate a publishing project. General practices in the editing, design, electronic publishing, indexing and printing fields are also discussed.

Over 85,500 copies sold, and still selling.
